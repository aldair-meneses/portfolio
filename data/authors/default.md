I'm a programmer from Brazil. I've been working on software professionally for about one year now. During that time I've developed with Solana blockchain, helping to build the core of my job to other devs can interact with the blockchain. Too I have some side-projects using React, GraphQL and something else.

Outside of my job I work on this blog writing about career and development. Too I help the community share some code of my job or some project on my GitHub or Twitter.

You can use "he/him" to talk with me.
